These in no way constitute an invitation to replicate individually or generally, not even implicitly. Trading suggestions or other information do not constitute an invitation to buy or sell securities or derivative financial products.

Tradingfreaks.com has taken sufficient measures to ensure the accuracy of the information on the website.",
      "risiki8": "Changes to the content of this website are reserved at any time and without prior notice.",
      "risiki9": "Stock, index, Forex currency, and CFD trading on margin involves a high risk and is therefore not suitable for every investor. Before considering the services and products of various brokers for derivative trading, you should carefully consider your investment goals, financial circumstances, needs, as well as your level of experience and knowledge.",
      "risiki10": "By trading and speculating with currencies, you could incur a partial or complete loss of your deposited funds with various brokers and should therefore not speculate with capital that you cannot afford to lose. Be aware of all the risks associated with derivative trading, particularly the possible obligation to cover losses with the respective brokers. Tradingfreaks.com recommends consulting an independent financial advisor.",
      "risiki11": "NextLevelTrading points out the particularly high risks in transactions with options, derivatives, and derivative financial instruments. Trading with options, CFDs, or derivatives is a financial futures transaction. The significant opportunities of financial futures transactions are accompanied by corresponding risks, which can not only lead to a total loss of the invested capital but also result in further losses that could lead to a demand for additional payment beyond the invested capital. If you do not meet the required margin, your position may be liquidated; you alone are responsible for any resulting losses. The use of an internet-based trading system carries risks, including but not limited to hardware, software, and internet connection failures.",
      "risiki12": "For this reason, this type of transaction requires in-depth and well-founded knowledge regarding financial products, financial instruments, and other tradable products, trading techniques and strategies on the securities markets.",
      "risiki13": "Only consumers who have read and understood the brochure 'Basic Information about Financial Futures' available at banks and savings banks according to § 37d WpHG and have read and signed the form 'Important Information about the Loss Risks of Financial Futures Transactions' are entitled to participate in trading options and other financial futures transactions. The customer acts at their own risk and peril.",
      "risiki14": "Risk Notice Futures",
      "risiki15": "Due to the leverage effect, disproportionate losses can occur. Please note that futures trading is subject to value and price fluctuations of the underlying assets. After trading suspensions, in volatile market phases, and between closing and opening prices, price changes can occur that may exceed the loss of the invested capital.",
      "risiki16": "Risk Notice Margin Trading",
      "risiki17": "Margin trading includes transactions based on the price movements of a product. The settlement is based on the difference between the opening and closing price of the transaction. Margin trading is only suitable for experienced investors with a high risk tolerance. There is a danger that you will lose more capital than you originally invested. Margin trading can lead to total losses and obligations to cover losses.",
